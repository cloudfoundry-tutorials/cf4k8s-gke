In our experience, we’ve observed that small teams and startups often don’t pick up Kubernetes because of two reasons — one is the steep learning curves. Second, for fear of introducing complexity in the workflow of their developers.

By providing a “cf” wrapper around Kubernetes-based infrastructure, both of these problems can be solved! The collective efforts of the Cloud Foundry community have resulted in the cf-for-k8s project which, when installed, allows application developers to deploy to Kubernetes using the tried and tested cf push workflow, which is known for its simplicity and ease of use. This way, teams no longer have to make a choice between simplicity, power, and the developer experience.

Kubernet-easy!
